# Data Science & Machine Learning Learning Lab

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in data science and machine learning.  
It is not a collection of isolated algorithms, but a space where I experiment, compare approaches, and strengthen my fundamentals through practical notebooks.

My primary end-to-end projects are maintained in separate repositories. This repo complements them by focusing on **exploration, experimentation, and model understanding**.

## Purpose of This Repository
The goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen core data science fundamentals
- Experiment with different modeling approaches on structured data
- Understand trade-offs between models rather than focusing only on accuracy
- Build intuition around preprocessing, evaluation, and interpretation

Each notebook here represents a focused learning objective rather than a finished product.

## What You’ll Find Here
The notebooks in this repository typically cover:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real-world datasets
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques
- Baseline models for classification and regression
- Model comparison and evaluation using appropriate metrics
- Observations and conclusions based on results

## How This Fits With My Projects
My resume highlights **end-to-end projects** such as customer churn prediction and NLP-based sentiment analysis.  
This repository supports those projects by showing the underlying experimentation and learning process that informed model choices.

In practice:
- End-to-end repos → show delivery and deployment readiness  
- This repo → shows depth, curiosity, and continuous learning  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Learning Philosophy
I believe strong data scientists are built by:
- Understanding baselines before complex models
- Analyzing errors, not just metrics
- Practicing consistently on real data

This repository reflects that approach.
