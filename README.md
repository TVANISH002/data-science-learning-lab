## 📚 Data Science & Machine Learning Learning Lab
Hands-on learning repository for practicing data science and machine learning concepts
through exploratory analysis, modeling, and experimentation on real-world datasets.

This repository focuses on **fundamentals and experimentation**, not deployment.
Each notebook represents a focused learning exercise rather than a finished product.

---

### Purpose
- Strengthen core data science and machine learning fundamentals  
- Practice exploratory data analysis and feature engineering  
- Experiment with different modeling approaches  
- Build intuition around preprocessing, evaluation, and interpretation  

---

### What you’ll find here
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on diverse datasets  
- Feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques  
- Supervised and unsupervised learning experiments  
- Model comparison and evaluation  
- Observations and insights documented within notebooks  

---

### How this fits with my projects
My primary end-to-end projects (forecasting, churn prediction, healthcare ML, NLP)
are maintained in separate repositories. This learning lab complements those projects
by documenting the experimentation and learning that inform model choices.

### Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook
