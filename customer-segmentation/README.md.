## 🛍️ Customer Segmentation with Clustering
Unsupervised learning project focused on identifying distinct customer segments
to support targeted marketing and business decision-making.

---

### Why this project
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand diverse customer behaviors,
design targeted campaigns, and allocate resources more effectively.
When no labeled target variable is available, **unsupervised machine learning**
becomes a powerful tool for extracting structure and insight from data.

This project demonstrates how clustering techniques can be used to move from
raw customer data to **actionable, data-driven personas**.

---

### Objective
To apply clustering algorithms on mall customer data to identify meaningful
groups based on age, income, and spending behavior, and translate those groups
into interpretable customer segments for marketing strategy.

---

### What I explored
- Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using 2D and 3D visualizations  
- Built multiple segmentation models using different feature combinations  
- Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters  
- Compared K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering approaches  
- Converted cluster statistics into clear, business-oriented customer personas  

---

### How it works
- Removed non-informative identifiers (CustomerID)  
- Encoded categorical variables (Gender)  
- Standardized numerical features for distance-based clustering  
- Built K-Means clustering models on:
  - Annual Income vs. Spending Score  
  - Age vs. Spending Score  
- Evaluated cluster structure using inertia curves and dendrograms  
- Interpreted clusters using aggregated statistics and visual analysis  

---

### Key insights
- Annual Income vs. Spending Score produced the most distinct and interpretable clusters  
- Different feature combinations reveal different behavioral patterns  
- A high-income, high-spending segment emerged as the most valuable customer group  
- Customer segmentation is not one-size-fits-all and depends on business objectives

### Dataset source
The dataset used in this project (`Mall_Customers.csv`) is sourced from a public
GitHub repository maintained by **GeeksforGeeks** as part of their learning datasets.

In the notebook, the dataset is retrieved using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeeksforgeeksDS/21-Days-21-Projects-Dataset
